# Fitness

This repository was created as a template for future fitness journeys.

I plan to use Hugo, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Decap CMS, and some free HTML template parts.

## Hugo: https://gohugo.io/
To build the static site from templated parts.

## GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com/
To serve up the static content

## Netlify: https://www.netlify.com/
To handle the token exchange for securing the CMS.

## Decap CMS: https://decapcms.org/
A lite weight Git based content management system.

## Free HTML templates: https://html5up.net/
A great source for website templates.

The majority of the code came from these sources:

1. Setting up Hugo with GitHub pages:
2. Setting up Decap CMS with Hugo: https://decapcms.org/docs/hugo/
3. Decap CMS with GitHub auth: https://decapcms.org/docs/github-backend/
4. Setting up Netlify: https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/oauth-provider-tokens/#using-an-authentication-provider
   * You don't need the site usage example
   * You will just point Netlify at your repository (it is a choice when setting up a site)
